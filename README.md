# Craigslist Jr
Forked from Dev Bootcamp. 
Single day Challenge, completed on March 30, 2017

## Learning Competencies

* Build a wireframe to model application views
* Use Active Record Associations
* Implement all four parts of [CRUD][]: create, read, update, and delete.
* Use the MVC pattern in web applications with proper allocation of code and responsibilities to each layer

## Summary

We're going to build a simple version of Craigslist.  This will be your first
web application that uses multiple models.

Keep in mind that this is not substantially different than a command-line
version.  Instead of reading in command-line arguments, we read in URL
parameters.  Instead of printing to the console, we print HTML and CSS.

We'll only have two models in a one-to-many relationship; no different than
your command-line TODO app.

The challenge repo includes a Sinatra skeleton as usual.
